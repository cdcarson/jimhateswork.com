	<td><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">I give up. I'm selling my project '84 gslse with an '88 TII engine and tranny. UPDATE! I took this thing to Protech in Austin to have it dyno tuned and spent $800 to find out that the trailing igniter/coil is probably bad. I drove it home from the dyno and the next day it wouldn't start. So that's it for the project for sure. Please somebody buy this so I don't have to part it out. I'm only asking $2500 for it, and if you read on, you'll see that that's a good deal. <br>The engine was a rebuild in the 88 it came from, but I don't know when or how many miles are on it. I'm not going to buy a compression tester and Autozone doesn't loan one out so I can't guarantee that the engine is good or not. All I can say is that I drove it and then the next day it wouldn't start. <br>It's got a Haltech E6k and 550 primaries and 720 secondaries cleaned at RC engineering.<br>I'm sure your first question is &quot;What the hell is that big damn aluminum thing sticking out of the hood?&quot; Well, not only is it a cool place to mount the ignition junk, it's also a fine way to manage the airflow through the heat exchangers to minimize cooling drag. There's a great book called </span></font><i><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Racecar Aerodynamics</span></font></i><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">, which should be required reading in elementary school, and you should read if you haven't. There are more pieces that aren't installed that create a tunnel around the intercooler, radiator, and oil cooler. Yes, I do agree that the ductwork should be welded, and remember, I started with nothing in that engine compartment. Things don't fit first try. And I love drilling and tapping holes anyway.<br>Nice oil lines, huh? Yeah, that was only $125 for two hoses. What a stupid hobby.<br>The aluminum tray holds the relays, pressure sensor, and fuses for the haltech. It also has a ground bar and power distibution bar for 12volt constant and 12volt switched. The intake plumbing works, but I never got to get aluminum pieces fabricated, hence the many silicone couplings and blow-off valve mounted on the fender wall. The cooling pipes are custom fabricated aluminum pieces though.<br><br><br><br><br>Notice the intake piece to the right. No, I won't sell it. And no, there is no other. Unless of course some other fool had the same project, had access to a foundry, spent 15 hours carving the foam mold, and spent 10 hours milling and polishing the cast aluminum piece until it was a work of art that smoothly transitions from the round inlet to perfectly match the triangular shape of the throttle body. It really is a nice piece.<br>I also removed the first set of butterflies out of the throttle body to increase flow. No, I don't want to know why Mazda put them there.<br>Also notice the cool little pulley and cable setup I made to take place of the oil metering pump actuator. There's at least 12 billet aluminum block-off plates on the motor and numerous brackets, like the one there for the throttle position sensor, that no one told me that I'd have to fabricate for this damn project.<br><br>The intercooler is mean, the Griffin radiator is mean, and the oil cooler is mean, but all RX oil coolers are mean anyway. The brackets to mount them are all over-built. This was such an incredibly huge amount of work to do, but the mosquitos were always there to help.<br><br>The exhaust is everything you see there: stainless flex coupler, JC Whitney glass pack, and a couple feet of 2.5&quot; tubing. What you don't see is a custom, mandrel-bent 2.5&quot; downpipe. I also took out that silly flap in the exhaust manifold. Yes it backfires. Yes flame shoots out. Yes it sounds like a low-flying airplane. And yes, it's perfect.</span></font></td>

	<td><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">I have a set of straight front fenders and the nose piece that is missing in the top pictures. I don't have the bumper cover. That was going to have to be fabricated to fit around the cooling air inlet. The whole idea was to have the only air entering the front of the car be going through the nifty ductwork and out through the hood.<br>I also have a 13b block with no front cover that I hope will go away with the car.<br><br>I have all the plastic pieces for the interior, and once they're installed and all the wiring you see is tucked away, it really looks nice. I even have the bottom piece of the steering column cover that is impossible to find down south. The key turns on the 12 volts, but the super-cool start button you see where the lighter used to be starts the little monster up. The tach, speedo, and HKS turbo timer aren't wired up, but the boost guage on the pillar and the oil pressure, water temp, and the Halmeter air/fuel work like champs. The cd player is wired up too, but there's no speakers. I don't even know why I put it in there because it's so fun to listen to all the hoise the turbo, blow-off, and exhaust make.<br>The MOMO steering wheel is nice and I put a power steering gearbox in this car, which doesn't have power steering, and that reduced the amount of turn-to-lock by at least half a turn each way. That combined with the smaller steering wheel make it steer like a racecar, but if this car gets tuned and you go over 150, I bet you crash.<br>The leather buckets are from a '93 and they are so much better than the piece of shits that came in the first gens, it's unbelievable. You can also see the battery box behind the passenger seat and there'll be a new battery in it connected to the all new battery cables I put in the car.<br><br>I can't even begin to figure out the amount of work put into this car, but I kept a list of what most of the parts cost. Unless you've done something like this, you can't imagine the three parts misery to one part satisfaction a project like it creates. This whole thing is custom work and the parts add up over $6400. I think Ari charges $1000 to install the Haltech alone, and I did a bang up job of it. I'm asking $2500.<br>Yes, $2500. I was asking $6000 at one point, but the dream of getting any money out of this is gone. No trades! Unless I find a box of money, there will be no more cars in my life. Here's the list, email me at jim@jimhateswork.com if you're interested. <br>Thanks to everyone else this project tormented, and thanks again Ari for helping that christmas eve (that was actually fun).</span></font></td>
